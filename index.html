				<h2>Project 1: USurvey App Prototype</h2>
				<p>As the leader of the USurvey project, I am proud to have designed and developed a high-fidelity prototype that addresses the issue of low response rates in university surveys. Our prototype allows professors and administrators to easily create and distribute surveys, and provides a convenient and engaging platform for students to complete them. By incentivizing students with a small amount of money that can be used within the university's economy, we have increased participation rates and improved the quality of data collected.</p>
				<p>Throughout the project, my team and I conducted extensive research on existing survey methods and identified their shortcomings. We used this information to design and develop a high-fidelity prototype that addresses these issues and provides a comprehensive solution to the problem. We evaluated the prototype through user testing and made iterative improvements to ensure that it met the needs of both students and faculty members.</p>
				<p>Our high-fidelity prototype is easy to use, intuitive, and provides a convenient way for students to complete surveys on their mobile devices. By filtering surveys based on areas of expertise, students are more likely to be interested in the topics and provide valuable feedback. The rewards and payment system also provides an added incentive for students to participate, further increasing the response rate.</p>
				<p>Overall, I am proud of the work my team and I have done on the USurvey project. We have developed a valuable tool for universities to collect reliable and detailed data from their students, and have addressed a long-standing issue in the surveying process. I am confident that our high-fidelity prototype will be widely adopted by universities and will continue to improve the surveying process for years to come.</p>

				<h2>Project 2: Worldwide Death Analysis Using Python</h2>
				<p>As the sole project leader for the analysis of global mortality patterns, I spent months delving into datasets and analyzing trends to gain a deeper understanding of this universal experience. Working alone, I was determined to uncover the secrets of death and shed light on its many facets.</p>
				<p>One of the first challenges I faced was wrangling the datasets into a usable format. The data contained 31 common causes of death and every recorded instance of each one from 1990 to 2019, and organizing it required a great deal of effort. However, once I had the data organized and cleaned, I was able to begin my analysis in earnest.</p>
				<p>One of my first tasks was to create a global map of deaths, which I did using plotly and geolocator. The resulting map showed the intensity of deaths in different countries and continents, with China and India standing out due to their high death rates. The map also highlighted which countries had the highest amount of deaths per continent, providing a valuable overview of the global mortality landscape.</p>
				<p>To dig deeper into specific countries, I selected a subset of the top ten countries with the highest number of deaths and identified interesting patterns or trends in their leading causes of death. Using modified dataframes that included the "Year" column as well as the top five causes of death, I created time series plots of the top five causes of death in each country from 1990 to 2019.</p>
				<p>To create forecasts about future mortality patterns, I used ARMA and ARIMA models to make predictions about the top causes of death in each country. This was a time-consuming process, as I had to create separate models for each country and each specific cause of death. However, the results were worth the effort, as I was able to create a comprehensive view of the trends and make informed projections about the future.</p>
				<p>The resulting analysis revealed many interesting findings, such as the correlation between different causes of death and potential relationships between causes of death and demographic factors. Throughout the project, I had to draw on a variety of skills, using tools such as pandas, scipy.stats, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib, geolocator, SARIMAX, and ARIMA.</p>
				<p>Working alone on this project was a challenging but rewarding experience. I gained a deeper understanding of global mortality patterns and uncovered many interesting findings. While there are still many potential avenues for future exploration of this dataset, I am proud of the work that I accomplished and the insights that I gained.</p>

				<h2>Project 3: An in Depth Analysis of Countries’ GDPs, Suicide Rates and Homicide Rates Using RStudio</h2>
				<p>Taking the role of project leader for this research endeavor, I had to embrace the challenges of leading a team and making sure that we achieved our goals. It was my first time assuming this role, so I was a bit nervous, but I knew I had to step up and take charge. Throughout the project, I learned a lot about leadership and management, including how to delegate tasks, manage timelines, and communicate effectively with my team.</p>
				<p>This project was also my first large-scale programming project, not just in RStudio, but in my programming career in general. I had to familiarize myself with new coding techniques and best practices, which proved to be a challenging but rewarding experience. Through this project, I was able to develop my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using R.</p>
				<p>Our exploration of the data involved creating a variety of visual models, which provided us with a rough idea of the predictors that had an effect on suicide and homicide rates. We found that high income countries had the highest suicide rates, along with Central Europe & Baltics, which shared the same statistic but for administrative regions. We also discovered that while homicide rates decreased almost exponentially as GDP per capita increased, suicide rates started increasing again after a GDP of 10 trillion. These trends suggest that mental health may be a significant factor in both suicide and homicide rates, an aspect that unfortunately was not covered in our data set.</p>
				<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing suicide and homicide rates, we created two different forms of linear models. We began with a manual model and then used a step algorithm to create a more ideal model. While the manual model for homicide was already the best model that could be created, the step model for suicide was substantially different, with admin region, income level, and GDP being removed as predictor variables. Comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the two models over 100 folds, we found that the step model was the better choice. Our models revealed that GDP per capita and homicide rates significantly influenced suicide rates, while admin region and low income level had a significant impact on homicide rates. Additionally, we found that suicide rates had a significant effect on homicide rates.</p>
				<p>To determine if the means of suicide and homicide rates were uniform across the globe, we conducted an ANOVA test and plotted the results. The test showed that the means were not uniform, highlighting the need for further research and intervention to address these important social issues.</p>
				<p>Throughout our project, we encountered some limitations, such as the overall lack of normality in the model, as highlighted by the Q-Q plots. Nonetheless, our findings provide valuable insights into the causes and trends of suicide and homicide rates around the world. It is evident that a viable solution to decreasing these rates would be to invest in areas of low GDP/GDP per capita, as this could provide an economic boost that would make citizens more hopeful and less likely to resort to extreme actions. For higher income countries experiencing high rates of suicide and homicide, solutions that involve helping those with mental health problems could potentially combat these rising rates.</p>
				<p>Our team worked diligently to explore and analyze the data on suicide and homicide rates, and I am proud of the insights and recommendations that we have generated. I am grateful for that opportunity to take on the role of project leader and for the chance to have applied my programming skills in a real-world setting. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I look forward to taking on more projects like this one in the future.</p>
