				<h2>Project 1: USurvey App Prototype</h2>
				<p>As the leader of the USurvey project, I am proud to have designed and developed a high-fidelity prototype that addresses the issue of low response rates in university surveys. Our prototype allows professors and administrators to easily create and distribute surveys, and provides a convenient and engaging platform for students to complete them. By incentivizing students with a small amount of money that can be used within the university's economy, we have increased participation rates and improved the quality of data collected.</p>
				<p>Throughout the project, my team and I conducted extensive research on existing survey methods and identified their shortcomings. We used this information to design and develop a high-fidelity prototype that addresses these issues and provides a comprehensive solution to the problem. We evaluated the prototype through user testing and made iterative improvements to ensure that it met the needs of both students and faculty members.</p>
				<p>Our high-fidelity prototype is easy to use, intuitive, and provides a convenient way for students to complete surveys on their mobile devices. By filtering surveys based on areas of expertise, students are more likely to be interested in the topics and provide valuable feedback. The rewards and payment system also provides an added incentive for students to participate, further increasing the response rate.</p>
				<p>Overall, I am proud of the work my team and I have done on the USurvey project. We have developed a valuable tool for universities to collect reliable and detailed data from their students, and have addressed a long-standing issue in the surveying process. I am confident that our high-fidelity prototype will be widely adopted by universities and will continue to improve the surveying process for years to come.</p>

				<h2>Project 2: Worldwide Death Analysis Using Python</h2>
				<p>As the sole project leader for the analysis of global mortality patterns, I spent months delving into datasets and analyzing trends to gain a deeper understanding of this universal experience. Working alone, I was determined to uncover the secrets of death and shed light on its many facets.</p>
				<p>One of the first challenges I faced was wrangling the datasets into a usable format. The data contained 31 common causes of death and every recorded instance of each one from 1990 to 2019, and organizing it required a great deal of effort. However, once I had the data organized and cleaned, I was able to begin my analysis in earnest.</p>
				<p>One of my first tasks was to create a global map of deaths, which I did using plotly and geolocator. The resulting map showed the intensity of deaths in different countries and continents, with China and India standing out due to their high death rates. The map also highlighted which countries had the highest amount of deaths per continent, providing a valuable overview of the global mortality landscape.</p>
				<p>To dig deeper into specific countries, I selected a subset of the top ten countries with the highest number of deaths and identified interesting patterns or trends in their leading causes of death. Using modified dataframes that included the "Year" column as well as the top five causes of death, I created time series plots of the top five causes of death in each country from 1990 to 2019.</p>
				<p>To create forecasts about future mortality patterns, I used ARMA and ARIMA models to make predictions about the top causes of death in each country. This was a time-consuming process, as I had to create separate models for each country and each specific cause of death. However, the results were worth the effort, as I was able to create a comprehensive view of the trends and make informed projections about the future.</p>
				<p>The resulting analysis revealed many interesting findings, such as the correlation between different causes of death and potential relationships between causes of death and demographic factors. Throughout the project, I had to draw on a variety of skills, using tools such as pandas, scipy.stats, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib, geolocator, SARIMAX, and ARIMA.</p>
				<p>Overall, working alone on this project was a challenging but rewarding experience. I gained a deeper understanding of global mortality patterns and uncovered many interesting findings. While there are still many potential avenues for future exploration of this dataset, I am proud of the work that I accomplished and the insights that I gained.</p>
